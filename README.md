# Movie Booking Site

This project is a movie booking site built using React and Vite. It provides a fast and efficient setup for developing modern web applications with features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint integration.

## Features

- React with Vite for fast development
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for a seamless development experience
- ESLint integration for code quality
- Expandable configuration for TypeScript and advanced linting

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production:

### npm run build

The production-ready files will be in the dist folder.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Expanding the ESLint Configuration
If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enabling type-aware lint rules. Check out the TS template to integrate TypeScript and typescript-eslint in your project.
